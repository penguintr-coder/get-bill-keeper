            <p>Thank you for using Bill-Keeper. We are committed to protecting your personal
                information
                and your right to privacy.

                This document outlines our stance on privacy for Bill-Keeper, what data we collect,
                and how
                we use it.</p>
            <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                When you use Bill-Keeper to track your bills, you enter amounts, dates and category
                data. This will only be stored locally on your device and is completely anonymous.

                device. This information is stored to fulfil the service that Bill-Keeper sets out
                to provide.</p>

            <p>
                If you email feedback.billkeeper@gmail.com for support, you may share personally
                identifiable
                information with us, such as your email address and debug information. We retain any
                information received only as long as necessary to support your query and improve our
                customer service. The contents of any email you send will not be shared and we will
                never send you unsolicited emails.
